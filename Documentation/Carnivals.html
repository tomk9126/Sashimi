	<h1>Carnivals</h1>
	<h2>Managing Carnivals</h2>
	<h3>Opening Carnivals</h3>
	<p>The carnival sidebar provides the list of open carnivals. Selecting the ‘+’ button and choosing ‘Open Carnival’ will allow you to select and open a carnival file. That file will be added to the carnival list.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, you may use the Menu Bar: ‘File > Open > Carnival’</p>
	
	<h3>Saving Carnivals</h3>
	<p>Carnivals that have been modified but not yet saved will display an Asterix in their title. A warning will also appear if the user tries to close the carnival without saving their recent changes, as unsaved changes will be lost.</p>
	<p>Carnivals may be saved by choosing ‘File > Save’ in the menu bar, or more simply, ⌘ + ’S’</p>
	
	<h2>Creating a New Carnival</h2>
	<p>In the carnival sidebar, choose ‘+’ then ‘New Carnival’ (Note: you may also use ‘File > New > Carnival’ in the menu bar)</p>
	<p>The first screen lets you choose a name and date for your carnival. You can switch back and forth between the two screens using the tab bar.</p>
	<p>The second screen lets you import your Athletes. Use the ‘Import from Database (.csv)’ to import athlete data from a Comma Separated Value type spreadsheet. For more info on how to do this, see [Link’]Importing Athletes’. You may also use the ‘+’ and ‘-‘ buttons to create and delete athletes.</p>
	<p>To edit the athlete, simply select its row in the table and it will become editable.</p>
	<p>Sort order may be adjusted by clicking the headings in the top row of the table. The heading in bold represents the current sort order, and the adjacent error icon indicates whether the sort is in ascending or descending order. To toggle this, click the heading again.</p>
	<p>To find specific athletes, you may use the search and filter icons provided in the bottom left of the screen.</p>
	
	<p>Once complete, select ‘Create’</p>
	<p>Note: A carnival may be created with no athletes.</p>
	
	<h3>Editing a Carnival</h3>
	<p>Using the context menu on a carnival in the sidebar, and then clicking ‘Edit’ will allow you to edit the Name and Date of the sidebar.</p>
