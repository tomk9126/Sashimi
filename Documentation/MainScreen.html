	<h1>Main Screen</h1>
	<h2>The Sidebar</h2>
	<p>The sidebar displays open carnivals. These may be deleted, edited, closed via the context menu, or by selecting ‘Carnival’ in the menu bar when a carnival is the focused window.</p>
	<p>Clicking ‘+{icon}’, or by selecting ‘File > New > Carnival’ in the menu bar, the carnival creation menu will open. This will allow you to create a new carnival.</p>
	<p>The sidebar may be collapsed using ‘{icon}’</p>
	
	<h2>Carnival Toolbar</h2>
	<p>The toolbar provides the title of the currently selected carnival, tab bar, and toolbar items.</p>
	<p>The Tab Bar allows switching between Scoring and Athletes interfaces.
The toolbar items of the top-right provide the same actions allowed via the context menu, and will change to reflect whether the Scoring or Athletes interface is shown. Event/Athlete-altering actions (Edit, Delete, etc.) will be greyed out if nothing is selected.</p>
	
	<h2>Data Table</h2>
	<p>The carnival toolbar allows the user to switch between Scoring and Athletes data tables.</p>
	<p>The Scoring table displays the list of Events in the carnival. By selecting, or invoking the context menu, on an event will provide the same options as the toolbar.</p>
	<p>The Athletes table provides the list of athletes in the Carnival. By selecting, or invoking the context menu, on an athlete will provide the same options as the toolbar.</p>
	<p>These tables may be sorted by clicking on the header row. For example, to sort by Event name in alphabetical, click the header of the ‘Event name’ column. The heading in bold displays which column is the sort order, and the adjacent arrow will display whether the sort order is ascending or descending. This may be toggled by rechecking the heading.</p>
